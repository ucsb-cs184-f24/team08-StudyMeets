## Contribution Graph Analysis ##

We believe the contribution graph isn't the most accurate indicator of how much someone contributed to the project in terms of code. If we just look at the raw data there are a few outliers such as Luis's 22k lines of code commited or Garvin's and Tim's 7.5k and 7.8k lines of code deleted respectively. If you look further into the causes of those committs you can see Luis's is from creating the original project and Garvin and Tim's are from changing imports/libraries used which changed packagelock which is notoriously long hence the inflated lines of code commited/deleted. As for number of committs, they also don't reflect contributions well since trivial committs/edits to md files such as readme and daily scrums (while still important) shouldn't be equated to a single committ that contributes greatly to the project which makes up a non negligible amount of the committs for most members.

Additionally there are also other forms of contribution such as being an active reviewer, being the project direction leader, or creating new issue to progress the project that aren't reflected by how many lines of code or committs someone has done.

Ultimately the contribution graphs aren't a good indicator for the quantity and quality of contributions for the aforementioned reasons. A better, but more tedious method of analyzing someone's contribution would be to look at all the prs they made and how they play into the overal functionality and quality of the app.
