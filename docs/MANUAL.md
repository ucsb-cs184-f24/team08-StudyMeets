## Purpose of the Product ##
The purpose of StudyMeets is to create a dedicated platform for UCSB students to connect through study groups and social events, fostering both academic collaboration and social interaction within a safe campus community. The app addresses the challenge of finding like-minded peers by allowing users to discover and join study groups and events based on location, interests, and academic goals.
