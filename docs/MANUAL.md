# StudyMeets User Manual #

## Purpose of the Product ##
The purpose of StudyMeets is to create a dedicated platform for UCSB students to connect through study groups and social events, fostering both academic collaboration and social interaction within a safe campus community. The app addresses the challenge of finding like-minded peers by allowing users to discover and join study groups and events based on location, interests, and academic goals. With features such as student ID verification, location-based restrictions, and participant limits, StudyMeets ensures a safe and localized environment for its users. It also provides tools for hosts to create and manage groups, set participation limits, and define access criteria, while attendees can explore customized recommendations and search for groups by tag or topic. Additional features such as friend suggestions, college-specific events, and multiple verification options-including email domain checks and LinkedIn profiles-enhance its usefulness and inclusiveness. By combining academic and social opportunities, StudyMeets aims to strengthen the sense of belonging and collaboration among UCSB students, creating a vibrant and supportive campus experience.
